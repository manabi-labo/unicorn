  There's a couple of updates for Ruby 3.1, but we've finally
  started relying on Ruby 2.0.0 features after 9 years :P
  (so Ruby 1.9.3 users are stuck with older versions).

  And the usual round of doc updates and some build speedups.

  13 changes by the Bozo Doofus maintainer since v6.0.0:

        test_util: less excessive encoding tests
        drop Ruby 1.9.3 support, require 2.0+ for now
        drop unnecessary IO#close_on_exec=true assignment
        extconf.rb: get rid of unnecessary checks
        makefile: reduce unnecessary rebuilds
        HACKING: drop outdated information about pandoc
        http_server: get rid of Process.ppid check
        worker_loop: get rid of select() avoidance hack
        use EPOLLEXCLUSIVE on Linux 4.5+
        allow Ruby to deduplicate remaining globals
        epollexclusive: remove rb_gc_force_recycle call
        drop Ruby version warning, fix speling errer
        doc: v3 .onion updates, nntp => nntps, minor wording changes
